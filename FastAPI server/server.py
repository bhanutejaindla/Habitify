        Generate only three health recommendations, based on the userâ€™s health data. 

        The health habits provided by user are: {user_habits}

        If the health data is not provided give general health habit recommendations.

        Give the output as JSON objects with the following fields:
        title, description. Title should be as short as possible and should not match any habit from user_habits.

        DO NOT give any preamble or postamble.
        DO NOT use markdown format.
        Give exactly three health habit recommendations.
